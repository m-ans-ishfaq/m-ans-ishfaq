# 👨‍💻 Computer Science Student | Software Engineer

Hi, I’m a Computer Science student who writes code across the stack — and sometimes even understands it. I work on everything from **frontend interfaces** to **backend systems**, often in peaceful cooperation, occasionally in open war. I’m comfortable switching between **high-level scripting** and **low-level programming**, though only one of them feels like a survival game.

On a good day, I build clean, scalable systems. On most days, I scroll through decade-old StackOverflow threads, fix one-line bugs over the course of three hours, and deploy to production with the confidence of someone who definitely didn’t just whisper *“please work”* into their terminal.

I occasionally explore **AI tooling** and **automation frameworks** — not because I think machines are replacing us, but because I enjoy arguing with ones that don’t talk back. While the world debates the future of engineering, I continue writing **shell scripts** that break in *exactly* the same way every time — a form of reliability I’ve come to admire.

Outside of work, I build **experimental games**, sketch out **overengineered systems** I may never finish, and quietly pretend I’ll "learn infrastructure properly this weekend" — every weekend.

**Powered by caffeine ☕, calm under version control 🧘‍♂️, and passionate about coding 💻.**
