# 👨‍💻 Computer Science Student | Software Engineer

A full-stack human being loosely held together by coffee ☕, late-night debugging 🧠, and `git commit -m "final-final-FINAL"` — fluent in **HTML/CSS**, **JavaScript/TypeScript**, **React**, **Next.js**, **Node**, **Nest**, **Express**, **Rust**, **C**, **C++**, **C#**, **Java**, and whatever else the void demands 💻; juggling **MongoDB**, **PostgreSQL**, **Redis**, **MySQL**, **SQL Server**, and **Astra** like ticking bombs 💣; styling UIs with **Tailwind** while **Docker** breaks in new and exciting ways 🐳; deploying broken builds via **Vite** at 3AM like it’s tradition 🌙; writing **Bash** scripts on **Arch Linux** so I can casually mention `I use arch btw` in conversation 🐧.

Arguing with OpenAI APIs 🤖 for emotional closure; designing pixel-perfect architectures in **Figma**, **Photoshop**, and **Illustrator** 🎨; haunted by ghost projects 👻, cursed PRs 🧟, unread documentation 📚, and the weekly ritual of pretending this time I’ll “learn Kubernetes” — right before drowning in another recursive existential loop wrapped in a `try/catch`.

Also builds experimental games in **Unity** and **Godot** 🎮 when reality gets too stable.
