# 👨‍💻 Computer Science Student | Software Engineer
A full-stack human held together by caffeine and git commit -m "final-final-FINAL", fluent in HTML/CSS, JS/TS, React, Next.js, Node, Nest, Express, Rust, C, C++, C#, Java, and whatever else the void demands; juggling MongoDB, Postgres, Redis, MySQL, SQL Server, Astra like ticking bombs; styling UIs with Tailwind while Docker breaks in new and exciting ways; deploying broken builds via Vite at 3AM; writing bash scripts on Arch Linux so I can put `I use arch btw` in my resume; arguing with OpenAI APIs for emotional closure; designing pixel-perfect architectures in Figma, Photoshop, and Illustrator; haunted by ghost projects, cursed PRs, unread documentation, and the weekly ritual of pretending this time I’ll “learn kubernetes” — right before drowning in another recursive existential loop wrapped in a try/catch.v
