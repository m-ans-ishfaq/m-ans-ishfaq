# 👨‍💻 Computer Science Student | Software Engineer

Hi, I’m a Computer Science student who writes code across the stack and sometimes even understands it. I work with technologies like **React**, **Next.js**, **Node.js**, **PostgreSQL**, and **Redis**, often in peaceful cooperation, occasionally in open war. I’m comfortable switching between **JavaScript**, **TypeScript**, **C++**, and **Rust**, though only one of them feels like a survival game.

On a good day, I build clean, scalable systems. On most days, I scroll through decade-old StackOverflow threads, fix one-line bugs over the course of three hours, and deploy to production with the confidence of someone who definitely didn’t just whisper *“please work”* into their terminal.

I occasionally explore **LangChain** and LLMs, not because AI is taking over, but because I enjoy arguing with machines that don’t talk back. While the world debates whether developers will be replaced, I continue writing Bash scripts that break in *exactly* the same way every time — a form of reliability I’ve come to admire.

Outside of work, I like building experimental games in **Unity** and **Godot**, sketching out complex architectures I may never build, and quietly pretending that I’ll "learn Kubernetes properly this weekend" — every weekend.
